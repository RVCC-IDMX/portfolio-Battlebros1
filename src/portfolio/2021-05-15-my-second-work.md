description: This is the hummingbird poem that I made to test out some formatting and see how something would fit on a smaller screen then your standard monitor.

This assignment was used to see how things would look if they werenâ€™t just viewed on a computer and were viewed on something more narrow like a phone. I think that this one is the best one here because I think that it just looks the best out of the others. The spacing and the color I think all work well with one another. The dividers for each little section of the poem look good all around. I think that this one is the best when it comes to the bunch. I don't think that this one took me as long as others did and I think I was able to actually make this one work well with everything that was there. I would say that my skills were pretty good in this assignment but again I think they are still getting better with the things that I am making.
