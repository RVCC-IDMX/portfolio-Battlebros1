This  assignment was us testing out how to use Fraunces and figuring out its capabilities of what it can do. This work was testing out the basics when it came to Fraunces and how it could be used to make your websites better and look more appealing. This took me some time to figure out how things world and what could be done with this type of technology but I figured it out in the end and was able to change things up with it. Now this one right here definitely does not look great but for me it wasn't to look good it was more to see what it was capable of doing. This was one of the first assignments done to really get a grasp on what things could be done in CSS. I think that my skills have gotten better from this point and I have learned how to make things look better and fit more seamlessly together.
