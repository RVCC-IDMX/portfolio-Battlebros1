This work was used to pick out colors that really complimented the image that was displayed. The reason for calling it peanutâ€™s peanuts was I thought it would be funny if my cat named peanut sold peanuts on the side so that she could afford that good catnip. This assignment was not too bad in making and helped me understand what color could do for a webpage. The blend that made the color of the text boxes and the image really added to the nice feel that the whole thing had. This helped me improve my skills in making sure that I pick colors that complement one another and make the webpage come together much nicer. My skills are just improving and this certainly helped with that in making the best webpage that I can make.
